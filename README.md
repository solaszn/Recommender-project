Digital Marketing Recommender System - Final implementation

The problem - In most cases, businesses and marketing departments use different social media channels and digital marketing tools to increase brand awareness and find them difficult to manage all at once, eventually resulting in more needless staff recruitment or outsourcing to another person or social media influencer, likely at a cost and potentially less exposure and audience. The problem this study is to solve is “Who is your target market and where are they digitally”?
 
The aim of this study is to implement a system that recommends digital marketing technologies (e.g. Paid advertisements, social media tools, blogs) to be employed as marketing strategies, it employs machine learning in analyzing digital marketing and ad placement options with respect to difference between businesses.

July 9th - Algorithm roadmap
-	State the question and determine required data
-	Acquire the data in an accessible format
-	Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
-	Prepare the data for the machine learning model
-	Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
-	Train the model on the training data
-	Make predictions on the test data
-	Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance 	metrics
-	If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or 	try a different modeling technique
-	Interpret model and report results visually and numerically

July 10th - DOM, master.py recommend(), and Database
-	Research eel extensively
-	Define Application structure
-	Design frames left.
-	....

July 15th - Prototype build and package [DONE]
-	Using eel establish communication between JS script and python server.
-	Design prototype interface
-	Build prototype to achieve saving User testing cases into file.txt
-	Offer for Beta-Testing
-	Add all services
-	Package to .exe
-	Run Manually from  "cd C:/Projects/v1/test" --python main.py

July 20th - Application Development Roadmap
Flask - Backend framework
##Flow 3
-	Design a database model diagram
-	Create RESTFul routes on "server.py"
-	Write Login, Register, Session.Initialize and Logout code
